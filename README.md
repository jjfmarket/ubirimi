Get started using our pre-made development server
-------------------------------------------------

Ubirimi is an open source, community-driven project. If you would like to contribute just send pull requests. To get started clone the repository. 

Inside then newly created project, from the terminal run the following commands:

`vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`

If you have problems installing the plugin try running

`sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev`

then run
 
`vagrant up`

`vagrant ssh`

You can log in into the dev vm by executing "vagrant ssh ubirimi". Once inside do: 

`cd /var/www`

`composer setup`

In the setup procedure when asked for the URL enter http://ubirimi.dev

Sometimes it is needed to restart the apache web server. Do this by executing: 
`/etc/init.d/apache2 restart`

You will be all set with a working project.

To test the working ubirimi environment enter in a browser the url: http://ubirimi.dev
You should get a login screen into the platform. You can use the credentials provided during the setup procedure.
